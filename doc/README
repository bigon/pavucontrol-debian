Overview

   PulseAudio Volume Control (pavucontrol) is a simple GTK based volume
   control tool ("mixer") for the [20]PulseAudio sound server. In contrast
   to classic mixer tools this one allows you to control both the volume
   of hardware devices and of each playback stream separately.

   Everybody loves [21]screenshots.

Current Status

   Works perfectly.

Documentation

   There is not much to say. Just run pavucontrol and see for yourself.

Requirements

   Currently, pavucontrol is tested on Linux only.

   pavucontrol was developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux "testing" from
   April 2006, it should work on most other Linux distributions (and maybe
   Unix versions) since it uses GNU autoconf for source code
   configuration.

   pavucontrol requires [22]gtkmm and glademmm installed.

   Obviously pavucontrol requires an installation of [23]PulseAudio
   (version 0.9.5).

Installation

   As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
   ./configure inside the distribution directory for configuring the
   source tree. After that you should run make for compilation and make
   install (as root) for installation of pavucontrol.

Acknowledgements

   None so far.
